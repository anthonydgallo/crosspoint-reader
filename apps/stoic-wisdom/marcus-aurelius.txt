MEDITATIONS - Marcus Aurelius

"You have power over your mind, not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."

"The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts."

"Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one."

"When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive -- to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love."

"Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking."

"The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury."

"Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with whom fate brings you together, and do so with all your heart."

"Never esteem anything as of advantage to you that will make you break your word or lose your self-respect."

"It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live."

"The soul becomes dyed with the colour of its thoughts."

"Dwell on the beauty of life. Watch the stars, and see yourself running with them."

"Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth."

"If it is not right, do not do it; if it is not true, do not say it."
