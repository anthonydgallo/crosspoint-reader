ON TIME & MORTALITY

"It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a great deal of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested." -- Seneca

"Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now, take what's left and live it properly." -- Marcus Aurelius

"Let us prepare our minds as if we'd come to the very end of life. Let us postpone nothing." -- Seneca

"When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive -- to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love." -- Marcus Aurelius

"Putting things off is the biggest waste of life: it snatches away each day as it comes, and denies us the present by promising the future." -- Seneca

"Do not act as if you had ten thousand years to live. Death hangs over you. While you live, while it is in your power, be good." -- Marcus Aurelius

"How long are you going to wait before you demand the best for yourself?" -- Epictetus

"While we are postponing, life speeds by." -- Seneca

"Loss is nothing else but change, and change is Nature's delight." -- Marcus Aurelius
