When the country is ruled with a light hand,
the people are simple.
When the country is ruled with severity,
the people are cunning.

Happiness is rooted in misery.
Misery lurks beneath happiness.
Who knows what the future holds?

There is no honesty.
Honesty becomes dishonest.
Goodness becomes witchcraft.
People's confusion lasts for a long time.

Therefore the sage is sharp but not cutting,
pointed but not piercing,
straightforward but not unrestrained,
brilliant but not blinding.
