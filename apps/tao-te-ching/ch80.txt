A small country has fewer people.
Though there are machines that can work
ten to a hundred times faster than man,
they are not needed.
The people take death seriously
and do not travel far.

Though they have boats and carriages,
no one uses them.
Though they have armour and weapons,
no one displays them.

People return to the knotting of rope in place of writing.
Their food is plain and good,
their clothes fine but simple,
their homes secure;
they are happy in their ways.

Though they live within sight of their neighbours,
and crowing cocks and barking dogs
are heard across the way,
yet they leave each other in peace
while they grow old and die.
