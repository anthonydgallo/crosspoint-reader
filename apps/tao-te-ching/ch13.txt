Favour and disgrace make one fearful.
The greatest misfortune is the self.

What is meant by "favour and disgrace make one fearful"?
Favour is debasing;
gaining it one is fearful,
losing it one is fearful.

What is meant by "the greatest misfortune is the self"?
The reason I have great misfortune
is that I have a self.
When I no longer have a self,
what misfortune can I have?

Surrender yourself humbly; then you can be
trusted to care for all things.
Love the world as your own self;
then you can truly care for all things.
