Look, it cannot be seen -- it is beyond form.
Listen, it cannot be heard -- it is beyond sound.
Grasp, it cannot be held -- it is intangible.

These three are indefinable
and therefore merge into one.

Its rising brings no light;
its sinking, no darkness.
Unbroken, unnameable, it returns to nothingness.

The form of the formless,
the image of the imageless,
it is called indefinable and beyond imagination.

Stand before it and there is no beginning.
Follow it and there is no end.
Stay with the ancient Tao,
move with the present.
