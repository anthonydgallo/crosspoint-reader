That which shrinks
must first expand.
That which fails
must first be strong.
That which is cast down
must first be raised.
Before receiving, there must be giving.

This is called perception of the nature of things.

Soft and weak overcome hard and strong.

Fish cannot leave deep waters,
and a country's weapons should not be displayed.
