The Tao begot one.
One begot two.
Two begot three.
And three begot the ten thousand things.

The ten thousand things carry yin and embrace yang.
They achieve harmony by combining these forces.

People hate to be "orphaned," "widowed," or "worthless,"
but this is how kings and lords describe themselves.

For one gains by losing
and loses by gaining.

What others teach, I also teach:
"A violent man will die a violent death."
This will be the essence of my teaching.
