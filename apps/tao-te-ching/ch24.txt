He who stands on tiptoe is not steady.
He who strides cannot maintain the pace.
He who makes a show is not enlightened.
He who is self-righteous is not respected.
He who boasts achieves nothing.
He who brags will not endure.

According to the followers of the Tao,
these are extra food and unnecessary baggage.
They do not bring happiness.
Therefore followers of the Tao avoid them.
