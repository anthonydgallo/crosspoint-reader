The heavy is the root of the light.
The still is the master of unrest.

Therefore the sage, travelling all day,
does not lose sight of his baggage.
Though there are beautiful things to be seen,
he remains unattached and calm.

Why should the lord of ten thousand chariots
act lightly in public?
To be light is to lose one's root.
To be restless is to lose one's control.
