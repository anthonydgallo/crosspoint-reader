Fame or self: which matters more?
Self or wealth: which is more precious?
Gain or loss: which is more painful?

He who is attached to things will suffer much.
He who saves will suffer heavy loss.
A contented man is never disappointed.
He who knows when to stop does not find himself
in trouble.
He will stay forever safe.
