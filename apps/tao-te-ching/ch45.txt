Great perfection seems imperfect,
yet it does not decay.
Great abundance seems empty,
yet it does not fail.

Great truth seems contradictory.
Great cleverness seems stupid.
Great eloquence seems awkward.

Movement overcomes cold.
Stillness overcomes heat.
Stillness and tranquillity set things in order
in the universe.
