When the Tao is present in the universe,
the horses haul manure.
When the Tao is absent from the universe,
war horses are bred outside the city.

There is no greater sin than desire,
no greater curse than discontent,
no greater misfortune than wanting something for oneself.

Therefore he who knows that enough is enough
will always have enough.
