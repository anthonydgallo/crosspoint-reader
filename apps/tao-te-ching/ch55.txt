He who is filled with virtue is like a newborn child.
Wasps and serpents do not sting him;
wild beasts do not pounce upon him;
birds of prey do not attack him.

His bones are soft, his muscles weak,
but his grip is firm.
He has not experienced the union of man and woman,
but is whole.
His manhood is strong.
He screams all day without becoming hoarse.
This is perfect harmony.

Knowing harmony is constancy.
Knowing constancy is enlightenment.

It is not wise to rush about.
Trying to control the breath causes strain.
If too much energy is used, exhaustion follows.
This is not the way of the Tao.
Whatever is contrary to the Tao will not last long.
