There is a saying among soldiers:
I dare not make the first move
but would rather play the guest;
I dare not advance an inch
but would rather withdraw a foot.

This is called marching without appearing to move,
rolling up your sleeves without showing your arm,
capturing the enemy without attacking,
being armed without weapons.

There is no greater catastrophe
than underestimating the enemy.
By underestimating the enemy,
I almost lose what I value.

Therefore when the battle is joined,
the underdog will win.
