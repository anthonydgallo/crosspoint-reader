Something mysteriously formed,
born before heaven and earth.
In the silence and the void,
standing alone and unchanging,
ever present and in motion.

Perhaps it is the mother of ten thousand things.
I do not know its name.
Call it Tao.
For lack of a better word, I call it great.

Being great, it flows.
It flows far away.
Having gone far, it returns.

Therefore, the Tao is great;
heaven is great;
earth is great;
the human being is also great.
These are the four great powers.

The human being follows the earth.
Earth follows heaven.
Heaven follows the Tao.
The Tao follows what is natural.
