True words are not beautiful.
Beautiful words are not true.
Good men do not argue.
Those who argue are not good.
Those who know are not learned.
The learned do not know.

The sage never tries to store things up.
The more he does for others, the more he has.
The more he gives to others,
the greater his abundance.

The Tao of heaven is sharp but does no harm.
The Tao of the sage is work without effort.
