Hold fast to the great image
and all the world will come.
It will come and not be harmed,
resting in safety and peace.

Music and food -- these attract the passer-by.
But words about the Tao
seem to them bland and without flavour.

Look, and it cannot be seen.
Listen, and it cannot be heard.
Use it, and it can never be exhausted.
