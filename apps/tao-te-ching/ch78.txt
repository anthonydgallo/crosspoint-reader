Under heaven nothing is more soft and yielding
than water.
Yet for attacking the solid and strong,
nothing is better;
it has no equal.

The weak can overcome the strong;
the supple can overcome the stiff.
Under heaven everyone knows this,
yet no one puts it into practice.

Therefore the sage says:
He who takes upon himself
the humiliation of the people
is fit to rule them.
He who takes upon himself
the country's disasters
deserves to be king of the universe.

The truth often sounds paradoxical.
