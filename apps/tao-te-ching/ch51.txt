All things arise from the Tao.
They are nourished by virtue.
They are formed from matter.
They are shaped by environment.

Thus the ten thousand things
all respect the Tao and honour virtue.
Respect of the Tao and honour of virtue
are not demanded, but they are in the nature of things.

Therefore all things arise from the Tao.
By virtue they are nourished,
developed, cared for,
sheltered, comforted,
grown, and protected.

Creating without claiming,
doing without taking credit,
guiding without interfering --
this is primal virtue.
