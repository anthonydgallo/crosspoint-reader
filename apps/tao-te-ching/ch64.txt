Peace is easily maintained.
Trouble is easily overcome before it starts.
The brittle is easily shattered;
the small is easily scattered.

Deal with it before it happens.
Set things in order before there is confusion.

A tree as great as a man's embrace
springs from a small shoot.
A terrace nine stories high
begins with a pile of earth.
A journey of a thousand miles
starts under one's feet.

He who acts defeats his own purpose;
he who grasps loses.
The sage does not act, and so is not defeated.
He does not grasp and therefore does not lose.

People usually fail when they are on the verge
of success.
So give as much care to the end
as to the beginning;
then there will be no failure.
