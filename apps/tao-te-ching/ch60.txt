Governing a great nation
is like cooking a small fish --
too much handling will spoil it.

Approach the universe with the Tao,
and evil will have no power.
Not that evil is not powerful,
but its power will not be used to harm others.

Not only will it do no harm to others,
but the sage himself will also be protected.

They do not hurt each other,
and the virtue in each one refreshes both.
