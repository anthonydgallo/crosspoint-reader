Carrying body and soul and embracing the one,
can you avoid separation?

Attending fully and becoming supple,
can you be as a newborn babe?

Washing and cleansing the primal vision,
can you be without stain?

Loving the people and ruling the country,
can you be without cleverness?

Opening and closing the gates of heaven,
can you play the role of woman?

Understanding and being open to all things,
are you able to do nothing?

Giving birth and nourishing,
bearing yet not possessing,
working yet not taking credit,
leading yet not dominating --
this is the primal virtue.
