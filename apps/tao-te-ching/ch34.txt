The great Tao flows everywhere, both left and right.

Ten thousand things depend on it;
it holds nothing back.
It fulfils its purpose silently
and makes no claim.

It nourishes ten thousand things,
and yet is not their lord.
It has no aim; it is very small.

Ten thousand things return to it,
yet it is not their lord.
It is very great.

It does not show greatness,
and is therefore truly great.
