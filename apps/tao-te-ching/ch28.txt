Know the masculine,
keep to the feminine;
become a channel for the world.
Being a channel, eternal virtue will not depart;
return to the state of infancy.

Know the white,
keep to the black;
become a pattern for the world.
Being a pattern, eternal virtue will not falter;
return to the boundless.

Know honour,
keep to humility;
become a valley for the world.
Being a valley, eternal virtue will be fulfilled;
return to the state of the uncarved block.

When the block is carved, it becomes useful.
When the sage uses it, he becomes the ruler.
Thus, the greatest ruler cuts least.
