These things from ancient times arise from one:
the sky is whole and clear,
the earth is whole and firm,
the spirit is whole and strong,
the valley is whole and full,
the ten thousand things are whole and alive,
kings and lords are whole and the country is upright.
All these are in virtue of wholeness.

Without clarity, the sky would crack.
Without stability, the earth would quake.
Without strength, the spirit would fade.
Without fullness, the valley would wither.
Without life, the ten thousand things would perish.
Without power, rulers would stumble and fall.

Therefore the humble is the root of the noble.
The low is the foundation of the high.
Princes and lords consider themselves
"orphaned," "widowed," and "worthless."

Too much success is not an advantage.
Do not tinkle like jade
or clatter like stone chimes.
