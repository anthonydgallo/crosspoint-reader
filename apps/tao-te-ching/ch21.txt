The greatest virtue is to follow the Tao and the Tao alone.

The Tao is elusive and intangible.
Oh, it is intangible and elusive, and yet within is image.
Oh, it is elusive and intangible, and yet within is form.
Oh, it is dim and dark, and yet within is essence.

This essence is very real, and therein lies faith.

From the very beginning until now
its name has never been forgotten.
Thus I perceive all things.
How do I know the ways of all things at the beginning?
By what is within me.
