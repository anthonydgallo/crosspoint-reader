Whoever relies on the Tao in governing
does not try to force issues
or defeat enemies by force of arms.
For every force there is a counterforce.

Violence, even well intentioned,
always rebounds upon oneself.

The sage does his job and then stops.
He understands that the universe
is forever out of control,
and that trying to dominate events
goes against the current of the Tao.

Because he believes in himself,
he does not try to convince others.
Because he is content with himself,
he does not need others' approval.
Because he accepts himself,
the whole world accepts him.
