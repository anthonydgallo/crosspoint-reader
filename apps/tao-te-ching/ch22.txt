Yield and overcome;
bend and be straight;
empty and be full;
wear out and be new;
have little and gain;
have much and be confused.

Therefore the sage embraces the one
and sets an example to all.
Not putting on a display, he shines forth.
Not justifying himself, he is distinguished.
Not boasting, he receives recognition.
Not bragging, he never falters.

He does not compete,
and therefore nobody can compete with him.

The old saying that "the flexible is preserved
and the stiff is broken" is indeed true!
When you are whole, all things will come to you.
