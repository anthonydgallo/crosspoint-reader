Not exalting the gifted prevents quarrelling.
Not collecting treasures prevents stealing.
Not seeing desirable things prevents
confusion of the heart.

The wise therefore rule by emptying hearts
and stuffing bellies,
by weakening ambitions
and strengthening bones.

If people lack knowledge and desire,
then the clever cannot act.
Act without action,
and nothing is left undone.
