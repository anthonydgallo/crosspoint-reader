A wise student hears of the Tao and practises it diligently.
An average student hears of the Tao and thinks about it
now and then.
A foolish student hears of the Tao and laughs aloud.
If there were no laughter, the Tao would not be what it is.

Therefore it is said:
The bright path seems dim;
going forward seems like retreat;
the easy way seems hard;
the highest virtue seems empty;
great purity seems sullied;
a wealth of virtue seems inadequate;
the strength of virtue seems frail;
real virtue seems unreal.

The great square has no corners.
Great talents ripen late.
The greatest notes are the hardest to hear.
The great image has no form.

The Tao is hidden and without name.
The Tao alone nourishes
and brings everything to fulfilment.
