Heaven and earth are impartial;
they see ten thousand things as straw dogs.
The sage is impartial;
he sees the people as straw dogs.

The space between heaven and earth
is like a bellows.
The shape changes but not the form;
the more it moves, the more it yields.

More words count less.
Hold fast to the centre.
