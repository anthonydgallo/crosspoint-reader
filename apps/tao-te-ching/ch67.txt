Everyone under heaven says that my Tao is great
and beyond compare.
Because it is great, it seems different.
If it were not different, it would have vanished
long ago.

I have three treasures which I hold and keep.
The first is mercy; the second is economy;
the third is daring not to be ahead of others.

From mercy comes courage;
from economy comes generosity;
from humility comes leadership.

Nowadays people shun mercy but try to be brave;
they abandon economy but try to be generous;
they do not believe in humility but always try
to be first.
This is certain death.

Mercy brings victory in battle and strength
in defence.
It is the means by which heaven saves and guards.
