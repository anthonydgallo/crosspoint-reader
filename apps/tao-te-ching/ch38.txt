A truly good man is not aware of his goodness,
and is therefore good.
A foolish man tries to be good,
and is therefore not good.

A truly good man does nothing,
yet leaves nothing undone.
A foolish man is always doing,
yet much remains to be done.

When a truly kind man does something,
he leaves nothing undone.
When a just man does something,
he leaves a great deal to be done.
When a disciplinarian does something
and no one responds,
he rolls up his sleeves in an attempt to enforce order.

Therefore when the Tao is lost, there is goodness.
When goodness is lost, there is morality.
When morality is lost, there is ritual.
Ritual is the husk of true faith,
the beginning of chaos.

The great master follows his own nature
and not the trappings of life.
He stays with the fruit and not the fluff.
He dwells in reality
and lets go of all illusions.
