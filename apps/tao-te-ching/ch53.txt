If I have even just a little sense,
I will walk on the great way,
and my only fear will be of straying from it.

Keeping to the main road is easy,
but people love to be sidetracked.

When the court is arrayed in splendour,
the fields are full of weeds,
and the granaries are bare.

Some wear gorgeous clothes,
carry sharp swords,
and indulge themselves with food and drink;
they have more possessions than they can use.
They are robber barons.
This is certainly not the way of the Tao.
