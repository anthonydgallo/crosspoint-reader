Good weapons are instruments of fear;
all creatures hate them.
Therefore followers of the Tao never use them.

The sage prefers the left in times of peace,
the right in times of war.

Weapons are instruments of fear;
they are not a wise man's tools.
He uses them only when he has no choice.

Peace and quiet are dear to his heart,
and victory no cause for rejoicing.

He who rejoices in victory
delights in the slaughter of men.
He who delights in slaughter
cannot fulfil himself in the world.

In happy occasions, the left is favoured.
In sad occasions, the right is favoured.
Conduct your triumph as a funeral.
