A great country is like low land.
It is the meeting ground of the universe,
the mother of the universe.

The female overcomes the male with stillness,
lying low in stillness.

Therefore if a great country gives way
to a smaller country,
it will conquer the smaller country.
And if a small country submits to a great country,
it can conquer the great country.

Therefore those who would conquer must yield,
and those who conquer do so because they yield.
