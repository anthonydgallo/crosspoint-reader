What is firmly established cannot be uprooted.
What is firmly grasped cannot slip away.
It will be honoured from generation to generation.

Cultivate virtue in yourself,
and virtue will be real.
Cultivate it in the family,
and virtue will abound.
Cultivate it in the village,
and virtue will grow.
Cultivate it in the nation,
and virtue will be abundant.
Cultivate it in the universe,
and virtue will be everywhere.

Therefore look at the body as body;
look at the family as family;
look at the village as village;
look at the nation as nation;
look at the universe as universe.

How do I know the universe is like this?
By looking!
