Thirty spokes share the wheel's hub;
it is the centre hole that makes it useful.

Shape clay into a vessel;
it is the space within that makes it useful.

Cut doors and windows for a room;
it is the holes which make it useful.

Therefore profit comes from what is there;
usefulness from what is not there.
