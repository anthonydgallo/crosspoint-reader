The Tao is the treasure of the good man
and the refuge of the bad.

Sweet words can buy honour;
good deeds can gain respect.
If a man is bad, do not abandon him.

Therefore on the day the emperor is crowned,
or the three officers of state installed,
do not send a gift of jade and a team of four horses,
but remain still and offer the Tao.

Why does everyone value the Tao?
Is it not because it is found without looking for it,
and sinners who seek it are forgiven?
That is why it is the greatest treasure of the universe.
