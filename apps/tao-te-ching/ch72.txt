When people lack a sense of awe,
there will be disaster.

Do not crowd their dwellings,
or make their lives weary.
If you do not oppress them,
they will not weary of you.

Therefore the sage knows himself
but makes no show of himself;
loves himself but does not exalt himself.
He lets go of that and chooses this.
