Do you think you can take over the universe
and improve it?
I do not believe it can be done.

The universe is sacred.
You cannot improve it.
If you try to change it, you will ruin it.
If you try to hold it, you will lose it.

So sometimes things are ahead
and sometimes they are behind;
sometimes breathing is hard,
sometimes it comes easily;
sometimes there is strength
and sometimes weakness;
sometimes one is up and sometimes down.

Therefore the sage avoids extremes,
excesses, and complacency.
