My words are easy to understand
and easy to perform,
yet no man under heaven knows them
or practises them.

My words have ancient beginnings.
My actions are disciplined.
Because people do not understand,
they have no knowledge of me.

Those that know me are few;
those that imitate me are honoured.

Therefore the sage wears rough clothing
and holds the jewel in his heart.
