The Tao is forever undefined.
Small though it is in the unformed state,
it cannot be grasped.

If kings and lords could harness it,
ten thousand things would naturally obey.
Heaven and earth would come together
and gentle rain fall.
People would no longer need laws,
for they would govern themselves.

Once the whole is divided, the parts need names.
There are already enough names.
One must know when to stop.
Knowing when to stop averts trouble.

The Tao in the world is like a river
flowing home to the sea.
