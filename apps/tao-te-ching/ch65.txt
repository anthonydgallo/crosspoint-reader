In the beginning those who knew the Tao
did not try to enlighten others,
but kept them in the dark.

Why is it so hard to rule?
Because people are so clever.
Rulers who try to use cleverness
cheat the country.
Those who rule without cleverness
are a blessing to the land.

These are the two alternatives.
Understanding these is primal virtue.
Primal virtue is deep and far.
It leads all things back
toward the great oneness.
