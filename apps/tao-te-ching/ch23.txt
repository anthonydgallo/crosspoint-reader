To talk little is natural.

High winds do not last all morning.
Heavy rain does not last all day.

Why is this? Heaven and earth!
If heaven and earth cannot make things last forever,
how is it possible for man?

He who follows the Tao is at one with the Tao.
He who is virtuous experiences virtue.
He who loses the way feels lost.

When you are at one with the Tao,
the Tao welcomes you.
When you are at one with virtue,
virtue is always there.
When you are at one with loss,
loss is experienced willingly.
