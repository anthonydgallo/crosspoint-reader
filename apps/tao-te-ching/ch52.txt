In the beginning was the Tao.
All things issue from it;
all things return to it.

To find the origin, trace back the manifestations.
When you recognise the children
and find the mother,
you will be free of sorrow.

If you close your mind in judgements
and traffic with desires,
your heart will be troubled.
If you keep your mind from judging
and are not led by the senses,
your heart will find peace.

Seeing into darkness is clarity.
Knowing how to yield is strength.
Use your own light
and return to the source of light.
This is called practising eternity.
