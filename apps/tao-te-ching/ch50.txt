Between birth and death,
three in ten are followers of life,
three in ten are followers of death,
and people who are simply passing from birth to death
also number three in ten.

Why is this so?
Because they live their lives
on the gross level.

He who knows how to live can walk abroad
without fear of rhinoceros or tiger.
He will not be wounded in battle.
For in him rhinoceros can find no place to thrust its horn,
tigers find no place to use their claws,
and weapons no place to pierce.
Why is this so?
Because he has no place for death to enter.
