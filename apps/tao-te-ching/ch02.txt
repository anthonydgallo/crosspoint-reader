When people see some things as beautiful,
other things become ugly.
When people see some things as good,
other things become bad.

Being and non-being create each other.
Difficult and easy support each other.
Long and short define each other.
High and low depend on each other.
Before and after follow each other.

Therefore the sage acts without doing
and teaches without saying.
Things arise and he lets them come;
things disappear and he lets them go.
He has but does not possess,
acts but does not expect.
When his work is done, he forgets it.
That is why it lasts forever.
