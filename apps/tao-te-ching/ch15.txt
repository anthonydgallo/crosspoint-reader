The ancient masters were subtle, mysterious, profound.
Their wisdom was unfathomable.
There is no way to describe them;
one can only describe their appearance.

Watchful, like men crossing a winter stream.
Alert, like men aware of danger.
Courteous, like visiting guests.
Yielding, like ice about to melt.
Simple, like uncarved blocks of wood.
Hollow, like caves.
Opaque, like muddy pools.

Who can wait quietly while the mud settles?
Who can remain still until the moment of action?

Observers of the Tao do not seek fulfilment.
Not seeking fulfilment,
they are not swayed by desire for change.
