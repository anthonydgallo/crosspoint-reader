5. Three friends split a $30 hotel bill,
paying $10 each. The clerk realizes the
bill should be $25 and gives $5 to the
bellboy to return. The bellboy keeps $2
and gives $1 back to each friend. Each
friend paid $9 (total $27) plus the $2
the bellboy kept = $29. Where's the
missing dollar?

Answer: There is no missing dollar. The
$27 the friends paid includes the $2 the
bellboy kept. $25 to the hotel + $2 to
the bellboy = $27. Plus $3 returned =
$30. The puzzle tricks you into adding
the $2 twice.
