BLEEDING CONTROL

SEVERE BLEEDING - ACT FAST

1. CALL 911 for heavy bleeding

   - Do NOT remove the cloth if soaked; add more on top
3. ELEVATE the injured area above the heart if possible
4. Apply a PRESSURE BANDAGE
   - Wrap firmly but not so tight it cuts off circulation
5. If bleeding won't stop on a limb:
   - Apply a TOURNIQUET 2-3 inches above the wound
   - Note the time it was applied
   - Do NOT remove it

NOSEBLEED:
- Sit upright, lean slightly forward
- Pinch the soft part of the nose
- Hold for 10-15 minutes
- Do NOT tilt head back
- Do NOT stuff tissue inside
