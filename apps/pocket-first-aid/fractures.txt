FRACTURES & SPRAINS

SIGNS OF A FRACTURE:
- Severe pain and swelling
- Deformity or unnatural angle
- Inability to move the area
- Bruising or discoloration
- Grinding sensation

FRACTURE FIRST AID:
1. Call 911 for severe fractures
2. Do NOT try to straighten the bone
3. IMMOBILIZE the injury
   - Splint it in the position found
   - Use stiff material (board, rolled magazine)
   - Pad with soft material
   - Secure with cloth strips above and below
4. Apply ICE wrapped in cloth (20 min on, 20 min off)
5. ELEVATE if possible
6. Monitor circulation below the injury (pulse, color, warmth)

SPRAIN FIRST AID (R.I.C.E.):
R - REST the injured area
I - ICE for 20 min every 2-3 hours
C - COMPRESS with elastic bandage (not too tight)
E - ELEVATE above heart level

SPRAIN vs FRACTURE:
- Both can cause pain and swelling
- If you hear a snap or see deformity, assume fracture
- When in doubt, treat as a fracture

SEEK EMERGENCY HELP IF:
- Bone is visible through skin
- Area below injury is numb, blue, or cold
- You suspect a spine, neck, or hip fracture
- Person cannot bear weight at all
