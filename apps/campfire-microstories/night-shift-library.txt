NIGHT SHIFT LIBRARY

Eli took the overnight shift because it was easy:
reshelve returns, run backup, drink coffee.

At midnight, the return slot clanged.
He checked the bin.
One book. Dry. Warm.

Title: "Tomorrow's Newspaper, Local Edition"
No barcode. No publisher.

Inside, the date was tomorrow.
Headline:
"Library Roof Saved by Night Custodian"

He laughed, then read the small column:
"Custodian moves ladder before storm drain clogs."

Outside, rain started hard enough to shake the glass.
Eli remembered the ladder left under the roof gutter,
exactly where runoff always flooded.

He moved it. Cleared the leaves. Water rushed free.

At 12:47, thunder rolled.
At 12:48, the return slot clanged again.

The bin was empty.
