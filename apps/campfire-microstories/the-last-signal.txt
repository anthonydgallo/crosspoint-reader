THE LAST SIGNAL

The emergency radio in the ranger tower had been dead
for six winters. Everyone in Pine Basin knew that.

At 2:11 a.m., it clicked on by itself.

"Tower Nine, report weather."

Mara froze, brush still in hand, halfway through
painting over the old call signs.

"Tower Nine, report weather," the voice repeated,
calm and patient, as if twenty years had not passed.

She picked up the mic.
"Who is this?"

Static. Then:
"If the fog reaches the lower road, do not send
anyone to Mile Marker 14."

By dawn, the valley disappeared under white fog.
At 14, the road had collapsed in the night.

The radio has stayed quiet since.

Mara still keeps it plugged in.
