PAPER MAP TO MORNING

Nova bought the map at a gas station where the clerk
said, "Only use it after midnight."

It looked normal until 12:00, when a thin silver line
appeared from her porch to a point labeled MORNING.

Curious beat caution.
She followed it through sleeping streets,
across a bridge, up a hill she had never noticed.

At the top sat a bench and a view of the whole town.
No traffic. No noise. Just stars and cold air.

On the bench was a note in her own handwriting:
"You needed one quiet place. Keep this one."

By sunrise, the silver ink had faded.
The map showed only ordinary roads.

But the hill was still there.
Now she goes every week, just before dawn.
