15-MINUTE SPRINT

Goal: produce one visible output in 15 minutes.
Examples: one drafted paragraph, one fixed bug,
one cleaned section, one answered email batch.

0:00-2:00 Plan
- Pick one output
- Define done in one line

2:00-12:00 Execute
- Work in silence
- If blocked, write "BLOCKED BY: ___" and keep moving

12:00-14:00 Finish Pass
- Tighten wording or test result
- Remove obvious errors

14:00-15:00 Log
Write:
- What was finished
- Next step (single action)

Rule:
Done beats perfect. Ship the small win.
