5-MINUTE RESET

Use this when your attention is scattered.

0:00-1:00
Sit tall, inhale slowly for 4, exhale for 6.
Repeat 6 breaths.

1:00-2:00
Write one sentence:
"The one thing I need to finish next is: ____"

2:00-3:00
Clear friction:
- Put phone out of reach
- Close extra tabs/apps
- Keep only one task visible

3:00-5:00
Work only on the smallest complete step.
No context switching.

Finish line:

If not, repeat this reset once.
