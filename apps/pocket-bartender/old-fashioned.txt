OLD FASHIONED

The quintessential whiskey cocktail.
Simple, strong, and timeless.

INGREDIENTS
- 2 oz bourbon or rye whiskey
- 1 sugar cube (or 1/2 tsp simple syrup)
- 2-3 dashes Angostura bitters
- Orange peel
- Ice (one large cube preferred)

METHOD
1. Place sugar cube in a rocks glass.
2. Add bitters directly onto the sugar.
3. Add a splash of water.
4. Muddle until sugar is dissolved.
5. Add whiskey and stir gently.
6. Add one large ice cube.
7. Express the oil from an orange peel
   over the glass and drop it in.

GLASS: Rocks / Old Fashioned glass

TIP: Use a large ice cube -- it melts
slower and keeps the drink cold without
diluting it too quickly.
