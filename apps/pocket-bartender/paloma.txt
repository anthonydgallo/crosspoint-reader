PALOMA

Mexico's favorite tequila cocktail.
Arguably better than a margarita.

INGREDIENTS
- 2 oz tequila (blanco or reposado)
- 1/2 oz fresh lime juice
- Grapefruit soda (Jarritos, Squirt,
  or similar)
- Pinch of salt
- Salt for rim (optional)
- Grapefruit wedge for garnish

METHOD
1. Optional: run a lime wedge around the
   rim and dip in salt.
2. Fill a highball glass with ice.
3. Add tequila, lime juice, and a
   pinch of salt.
4. Top with grapefruit soda.
5. Stir gently to combine.
6. Garnish with a grapefruit wedge.

GLASS: Highball / Collins glass

TIP: For a fresher version, use fresh
grapefruit juice plus plain soda water
and a touch of simple syrup instead of
grapefruit soda.
