WHISKEY SOUR

Tart, sweet, and dangerously drinkable.
The sour that started them all.

INGREDIENTS
- 2 oz bourbon
- 3/4 oz fresh lemon juice
- 3/4 oz simple syrup
- 1/2 oz egg white (optional, for foam)
- Angostura bitters for garnish
- Cherry and orange slice for garnish

METHOD
1. If using egg white: add all liquid
   ingredients to a shaker without ice.
   Dry shake vigorously for 10 seconds.
2. Add ice and shake again for 15
   seconds.
3. Strain into a rocks glass over fresh
   ice (or a coupe glass without ice).
4. Dash a few drops of Angostura on the
   foam and drag a toothpick through
   them for a decorative pattern.
5. Garnish with a cherry and orange.

GLASS: Rocks glass or coupe

TIP: The egg white is optional but makes
a huge difference -- it creates a silky,
frothy texture. No egg taste, just velvet.
