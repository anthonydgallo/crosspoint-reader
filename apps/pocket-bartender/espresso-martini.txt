ESPRESSO MARTINI

The perfect pick-me-up cocktail.
Coffee meets cocktail hour.

INGREDIENTS
- 2 oz vodka
- 1 oz fresh espresso (cooled slightly)
- 1/2 oz coffee liqueur (Kahlua)
- 1/2 oz simple syrup
- 3 coffee beans for garnish

METHOD
1. Pull a fresh shot of espresso and
   let it cool for a minute.
2. Add vodka, espresso, coffee liqueur,
   and simple syrup to a shaker.
3. Fill with ice and shake hard for
   15-20 seconds. The espresso needs
   a vigorous shake to create the
   signature foam.
4. Double-strain into a chilled coupe
   or martini glass.
5. Garnish with three coffee beans
   on the foam.

GLASS: Coupe or martini glass

TIP: The hard shake is essential. It
creates the creamy foam layer on top
that makes this drink iconic.
