MANHATTAN

Sophisticated and spirit-forward.
The king of whiskey cocktails.

INGREDIENTS
- 2 oz rye whiskey (or bourbon)
- 1 oz sweet vermouth
- 2-3 dashes Angostura bitters
- Maraschino cherry for garnish

METHOD
1. Add whiskey, sweet vermouth, and
   bitters to a mixing glass.
2. Fill with ice and stir for about
   30 seconds until well chilled.
3. Strain into a chilled coupe or
   martini glass.
4. Garnish with a cherry.

GLASS: Coupe or martini glass

TIP: Rye whiskey gives a spicier, drier
Manhattan. Bourbon makes it rounder and
sweeter. Both are excellent -- try both
and find your preference.
