DAIQUIRI

Elegant simplicity. Three ingredients,
perfectly balanced. Not a frozen slushie.

INGREDIENTS
- 2 oz white rum
- 1 oz fresh lime juice
- 3/4 oz simple syrup
- Lime wheel for garnish

METHOD
1. Combine rum, lime juice, and simple
   syrup in a cocktail shaker.
2. Fill with ice and shake vigorously
   for 15 seconds.
3. Fine-strain into a chilled coupe
   glass.
4. Garnish with a lime wheel.

GLASS: Coupe glass

TIP: This is a classic daiquiri, not the
frozen blended version. It should be
crisp, tart, and served straight up.
The quality of the rum matters here --
choose something smooth.
